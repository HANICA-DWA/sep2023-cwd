# Unit 0 - Git and Software

### Software to install and use:

For Windows users before checking the list below, install:

- [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install)
- [Windows Package manager (winget)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/)

1. _Browsers:_ Make sure you have at least [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) installed.
2. _Server software:_ Make sure you choose **64-bit** versions of all software!
   - Install version 16 (or higher) of Node.js. Use either [this Windows tutorial](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/package-manager/#windows-1)
     or [this MacOS tutorial](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/package-manager/#macos).
   - Install MongoDB version 7.0 or higher. There are [instructions for Windows](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) and [instructions for MacOS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/). MacOS users: we recommend using the 'HomeBrew' method described in the MacOS instructions. You'll have to install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) first.
3. _Tools:_
   - Install [Studio3T](https://studio3t.com/download-studio3t-free/). Studio3T used to be called "RoboMongo". In most documents in the DWA courses we're still calling it "RoboMongo".
   - _Windows users:_ Install ["Putty"](http://www.putty.org/). It allows you to login remotely to servers, but it is also needed as an alternative to "telnet". (MacOS users: you have a Terminal program and a decent telnet program already installed.)
   - _Windows users:_ Install the command-line [Git](https://git-scm.com/) tool. Most of you won't be using it directly, but it is sometimes handy for some troubleshooting. (MacOS users: you already have a workable Git installed as part of MacOS).
4. _Editor:_ There are many tools available to edit source-code. The following options are the ones that you teachers have experience with. With other editors, wthey may not be able to help you if there are problems.
   - If you like Integrated Development Environments (IDE's), we recommend [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). Use [this page](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) to apply for a free student license.
   - If you prefer using a programmer's editor, we recommend [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The teachers use this as well.
5. _Git tool_: Install **[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)**, unless you want to use the command-line Git, or the built-in Git facilities in WebStorm VSCode.

### Git Introductory Tutorial

We have two versions of a minimalistic hands on introduction
to Git and Github that covers just enough to comfortably use these
tools in both DWA courses.
These are adapted from the site [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/).
