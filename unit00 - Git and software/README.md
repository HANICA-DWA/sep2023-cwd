# Unit 0 - Git and Software

### Software to install and use:

1. *Browsers:* Make sure you have at least [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) installed.
1. *Server software:* Make sure you choose **64-bit** versions of all software!
   - Install version 8.4 (or higher) of Node.js. Use either [this Windows tutorial](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-nodejs-tutorial-windows/)
     or [this MacOS tutorial](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-nodejs-tutorial-mac-os-x/).
   - Install MondoDB version 3.4 or higher. There are [instructions for Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) and [instructions for MacOS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/). MacOS users: we recommend using the 'HomeBrew' method described in the MacOS instructions. You'll have to install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) first.
1. *Tools:*
   - Install [Robo3T](https://robomongo.org/). Robo3T used to be called "RoboMongo". In most documents in the DWA courses we're still calling it "RoboMongo".
   - *Windows users:* Install ["Putty"](http://www.putty.org/). It allows you to login remotely to servers, but it is also needed as an alternative to "telnet". (MacOS users: you have a Terminal program and a decent telnet program already installed.)
   - *Windows users:* Install the command-line [Git](https://git-scm.com/) tool. Most of you won't be using it directly, but it is sometimes handy for some troubleshooting. (MacOS users: you already have a workable Git installed as part of MacOS).
1. *Editor:* There are many tools available to edit source-code. The following options are the ones that you teachers have experience with. With other editors, wthey may not be able to help you if there are problems.
   - If you like Integrated Development Environments (IDE's), we recommend [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). Use [this page](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) to apply for a free student license.
   - If you prefer using a programmer's editor there are two popular options:
      * [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). A number of the teachers use this as well.
      * [Github's Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. If you choose to use Atom, be sure to install the Atom-package ["language-babel"](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) to enable support for ES6 and React.
2. *Git tool*: Install **[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)**, unless you want to use the command-line Git, or the built-in Git facilities in WebStorm.


### Git Introductory Tutorial:

We have two versions of a minimalistic hands on introduction
to Git and Github that covers just enough to comfortably use these
tools in both DWA courses.
These are adapted from the site [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/).
There are three ways to use Git:
- Using the **[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)**
  graphical interface. There are many more GUI-programs for Git,
  and most are fine. GitKraken is one that some of your teachers
  are familiar with. If you choose to use GitKraken,
  *[click here to start the tutorial for GitKraken](git_introductory_tutorial_gitkraken/lab_01.html)*.
- Using the **[WebStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)**.
  Most full-blown IDE's have support for using Git, but WebStorm is
  one that some of your teachers are familiar with. If you choose
   to use WebStorm for your Git-activities,
   *[click here to start the Git with WebStorm tutorial](git_introductory_tutorial_webstorm/lab_01.html)*.
- Using the **[original command-line Git](https://git-scm.com/)**.
  This is the cool tool for power users, but it is easy to make
  mistakes that may be difficult to repair. Your teachers are
  unlikely to be able to help you if you mess-up, but perhaps
  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/git/info) can help.
  If you choose to go with the commandline git, just go to the
  original site *[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)*,
  and do at least chapters ('labs') 01 to 08.

**Note:** Both Webstorm and GitKraken are updated frequently.
You may find that the screenshots in these tutorials do not
exactly match the screens you are seeing. They should be close
enough, we hope :-)
