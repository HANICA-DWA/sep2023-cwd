    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn how to inspect changes to files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Change the &#8220;Hello, World&#8221; program. <em>01</em></h2>

    <p>
        It&#8217;s time to change our hello program to take
        an argument from the command line. Change the file to be:
    </p>
    <h4>File: <em>hello.js</em></h4>
    <pre class="file">
    // use from command-line:  node hello.js "Bugs Bunny"
    // prints "hello Bugs Bunny!"
    'use strict';
    console.log('Hello, ' + process.argv[2] + '!');
    </pre>
    <p>There are three kinds of changes in this one little file:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Two lines were <i>added</i>: The comment lines at the top.</li>
      <li>One line <i>stayed the same</i>: The "use strict" line.</li>
      <li>One line was changed: the "console.log" line.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Check the status in GitKraken <em>02</em></h2>
    <p>
      Switch to GitKraken and notice that it sees the change, by mentioning "hello.js" in the "Unstaged Files". You may need to select the WIP-line in the middle column to see the "Unstaged Files" box.
    </p>
    <p>
      DO NOT COMMIT the changes yet!
    </p>

    <h2>Check the status in GitKraken <em>02</em></h2>
    <p>Click on the name of hello.js in the "Unstaged Files" box.</p>
    <p>The middle column with the commit history becomes very small, to make room for a new panel that shows how the file has changed:</p>
    <img src="_img/gk23.png" style="width:800px;" alt="" />
    <p>Green lines are lines that were added between the last commit and now.</p>
    <p>Red lines are, of course, lines that were deleted.</p>
    <p>Notice that a changed line is shown as a combination of a delete and an addition. This is usual for source code control systems, and Git is no exception.</p>

    <h2>See the same changes on Github <em>03</em></h2>
    <p>Bring the changes to Github:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Commit the changes to the local repo.</li>
      <li>Push the commit to Github.</li>
      <li>Reload the repo-page on Github in your browser.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Notice that, on the Github page, the commit message next to 'hello.js' has been updated.</p>
    <p>Now, click on <i>the commit message</i> next to 'hello.js' (i.e. not the file name!). Github shows the changes in a similar way.</p>
    <img src="_img/gk24.png" style="width:800px;" alt="" />
    <p>Such a way of displaying the changes to a file, by highlighting the lines that were added or deleted, is called a 'diff'.</p>
