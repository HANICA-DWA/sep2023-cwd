    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn how to push local changes to the remote repo</li>
    </ul>


    <h2><em>01</em>Push changes to your remote repo. </h2>
    <p>
        To update the remote repo with your local changes, you'll
        need to execute a push. This will apply all local commits since
        the last push to the remote repo, so you can apply
        multiple commits with one push.
    </p>
    <h4>But First:</h4>
    <p>Make sure your repo is clean: There should be no uncomitted changes in either the "Unstaged Files" box or the "Staged Files" box. No "WIP" line either.</p>
    <p>If you have uncommited changes, either commit them, or delete them by unstaging all staged files, and then discarding all changes.</p>
    <h4>Now, PUSH!</h4>
    <p>In the top row of the GitKraken screen, there's a button called "Push" (highlighted in the screenshot below):</p>
    <img src="_img/gk20.png" style="width:800px;" alt="" />
    <p>A simple press on "Push" should send the new commits to Github. Go ahead.</p>
    <p>After a notification that the push was succesful, only a subtle change in the GitKraken screen shows the effect of the push:</p>
    <img src="_img/gk21.png" style="width:800px;" alt="" />
    <p>The two "master"-labels have merged into one. This one contains both the "local repo" icon and the "github" icon. The "remote" repo on Github is no longer two commits behind.</p>
    <h4>Check it out</h4>
    <p>Reload your repo-page on the Github.com site.</p>
    <p>Notice that README.md <i>does</i> have the newly added line of text.</p>
    <p>Notice that hello.js exists, and has the right content.</p>
    <p>Notice that Github mentions the existence of 3 commits</p>
    <p>For both README.md and hello.js, Github shows the name of the last commit that affected the file next to the filename.</p>
